# 2019-11-15 Meeting Notes

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/agoric-labs/agoric-labs.github.io.git &&
pushd agoric-labs.github.io &&
git clone https://github.com/agoric-labs/markup.git &&
pushd markup;

yarn serve
```

## Running `index.mjs`

### Node Nightly

Nightly builds of Node.js come with unflagged ESM support — ie no longer need the `--experimental-modules` flag.

Use `n` to install from the nightly mirror:

```sh
NODE_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/ n v14.0.0-nightly20191115c71b89eb06
```

> You can look up the nightly builds here: https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/

Now you can:

```sh
node ./index.mjs
```

Now you can also:

```sh
node ./index.cjs
```

> This uses dynamic `import()` which is allowed even in CommonJS where ESM is supported.

### Node Experimental

The simpler route is to keep using the flag:

```sh
node --experimental-modules ./index.mjs
```

> This only works on supported version and will likely not throw or warn on newer versions where the flag is dropped.
